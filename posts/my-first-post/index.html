<p><a href="https://github.com/ix-ds-lisbon-s1-2019/week-1-project-crsimmons1">https://github.com/ix-ds-lisbon-s1-2019/week-1-project-crsimmons1</a></p>

<p>This game can be run in a terminal running the file name (in the directory where the file is saved) followed by an integer describing the number of players, which must be between two and seven. The first cell of code takes the user input, converts it to an integer, and puts it as the value <strong>NUMBER_OF_PLAYERS</strong>. Then it creates an empty list called <strong>names</strong>, and fills it with the user input using a for loop that runs once for each player.</p>

<p>The next cell has a list for the <strong>Values</strong> (integers from 2 to 14, for each card) and <strong>Rank</strong> (string of the cards in order from “2” to “A”). Then both lists are multiplied by 4 to create a deck with 4 of each card (called <strong>rank</strong> and <strong>value</strong>), although only rank is used. In the next cell, the deck has a random sample taken without replacement for the maximum number of cards that can be dealt (35, since each player gets 5 cards and the maximum number of players is 7) using the function called random.choice, creating a list called <strong>dealt_deck</strong>.</p>

<p>The next cell defines all of the possible hands for each player from the shuffled dealt_deck, creating lists <strong>hand1</strong> to <strong>hand7</strong>. The next cell prints each hand, using a while loop. This loop prints out the hand for each player based on the condition NUMBER_OF_PLAYERS, to make sure that the number of hands dealt matches the number of players. The next cell uses a for loop to convert each hand from string values to integer values.</p>

<p>The last cell determines and prints out the winner using a while loop based on the condition NUMBER_OF_PLAYERS. Each section in the loop makes a list of lists called <strong>hands</strong> which contains all of the individual hand lists for each player, and takes the maximum value of each list. The list that is created is called <strong>highcard</strong>. From this list, the maximum card is found, called the <strong>winning_card</strong>. The <strong>winner</strong> is defined as the index number of the list highcard, which should also be the index number of the name for the winner in the list names. Then, the loop prints the winner’s name using .format.</p>
